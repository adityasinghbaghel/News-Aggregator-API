# News Aggregator API

This project is a RESTful API for a news aggregator, built with Node.js using Express.js framework. It allows users to register, login, set their news preferences, and fetch news articles based on those preferences. It utilizes bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for token-based authentication, and incorporates external news APIs for fetching articles from various sources.

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Node.js and Express.js.
- Familiarity with bcrypt, JWT, and asynchronous JavaScript (async/await, Promises).
- Postman or Curl for testing the API endpoints.
